This sample can only be correctly used on Unity 2017 and above, as it was this version that introduced custom render textures.
Custom Render Textures templates located at package:
AmplifyShaderEditor > Plugins > EditorResources > Templates > CustomRTTemplates
must also be imported before being able to edit this sample over Amplify Shader Editor canvas
