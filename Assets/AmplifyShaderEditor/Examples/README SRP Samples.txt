Both samples contained at the 'HD SRP Samples.unitypackage' and 'LW SRP Samples.unitypackage' were created under the HD and LW SRP v3.0.0.
Before unpacking these samples, their respective templates must be imported.

If using Unity 2018.2.x, HD and LW v3.x.x:
Templates 'HDSRPTemplates (Legacy).unitypackage' or 'LWSRPTemplates (Legacy).unitypackage' under the folder (AmplifyShaderEditor > Plugins > EditorResources > Templates > SRP) should be unpacked.
 
If using Unity 2018.3.x, HD and LW v4.x.x:
Templates 'HDSRPTemplates.unitypackage' or 'LWSRPTemplates.unitypackage' under the folder (AmplifyShaderEditor > Plugins > EditorResources > Templates > SRP) should be unpacked.
Please notice that when unpacking the samples under this version, all the objects using ASE shaders will be pink. This is, like stated earlier, because they were compiled under SRP v3.0.0.
Each one of the shaders must be opened in ASE and updated with the correct template.
